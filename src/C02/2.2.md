### Exercises 2.1-1
***
Express the function ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n^3/1000 - 100n^2 - 100n+3)
 in terms of Θ-notation.

### `Answer`
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Theta(n^3))

### Exercises 2.2-2
***
Consider sorting n numbers stored in array A by first finding the smallest element of A and exchanging it with the element in A[1]. Then find the second smallest element of A, and exchange it with A[2]. Continue in this manner for the first n - 1 elements of A. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as **selection sort**. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the first n - 1 elements, rather than for all n elements? Give the best-case and worst-case running times of selection sort in Θ- notation.

### `Answer`

**Loop invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the outer for loop, the subarray A[1..i-1] consists of the i-1 sorted elements in the array A[1..n].

The last elements of the array is the smallest after all n-1 is sorted.

Both For the best-case and worse case, it still takes n-1 steps to find the smallest element in A[1...i], thus the running time of them turn to be ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Theta(n^2)).
