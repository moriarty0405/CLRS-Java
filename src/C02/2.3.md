### Exercises 2.2-1
***
Rewrite the MERGE procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping
once either array L or R has had all its elements copied back to A and then copying
the remainder of the other array back into A.

### Exercises 2.3-3
***
Use mathematical induction to show that when n is an exact power of 2, the solution of the recurrence
![](./fig/2-3/2.3-3.png) is $n\lg n$.

### `Answer`
* Assumption: $F(k)=T(2^k)$.
* When $k=1$, i.e. $n=2$, $F(1)=T(2)=2$.
* When $k>1$, assumes the recurrence is $n\lg n$, then $F(k)=2^k\lg 2^k$
\[
  F(k+1)=T(2^{k+1})=2T(2^k)+2^{k+1}=2*2^k\lg 2^k+2^{k+1}=2^{k+1}(\lg 2^k+1)=2^{k+1}\lg 2^{k+1} \\
\]

### Exercises 2.3-4
***
Insertion sort can be expressed as a recursive procedure as follows. In order to sort A[1..n], we recursively sort A[1..n -1] and then insert A[n] into the sorted array A[1..n - 1]. Write a recurrence for the running time of this recursive version of insertion sort.

### Exercises 2.3-5
***
Referring back to the searching problem (see Exercise 2.1-3), observe that if the sequence A is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against v and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. **Binary search** is an algorithm that repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is $\Theta(\lg n)$.

### `Answer`
* Pseudo code

![](./fig/2-3/2.3-5.jpg)
* Java code
[code](./BinarySort.java)
* Worst case analysis
For the worst case given an array with size of n, the target elements is the start or end of this array. Thus the running time $T(n)=\lg n + C$

### Exercises 2.3-6
***
Observe that the while loop of lines 5 - 7 of the **INSERTION-SORT** procedure in Section 2.1 uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted subarray A[1..j - 1]. Can we use a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-5) instead to improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to $\Theta(n\lg n)$?

### `Answer`
Binary search could find the position of the insertion with $\Theta(\lg n)$, but the new algorithm needs to move the elements of the array, it takes additional linear time to run.

### Exercises 2.3-7
***
Describe a $\Theta(n\lg n)$-time algorithm that, given a set S of n integers and another integer x,
determines whether or not there exist two elements in S whose sum is exactly x.

### `Answer`
* Use merge sort to sort the inputting array and apply binary search to find the ideal elements. The merge sort will take $n\lg n$ to complete and the next procedure will also cost $n * \lg n$ unit time. Thus the total running time is $\Theta(n\lg n)$.
 * The data structure hashtable takes $\Theta(n)$ unit time to finish the task as it need not to sort the inputting array, linear search of the elements is enough to complete.
